The Carhart Mansion is an Upper East Side development originally designed by architect Horace Trumbauer in 1916, and currently it is subdivided into four separate luxury condoniums, with one triplex, one duplex, one simplex, and one two-story penthouse.

&#8593; plans of the triplex, with two above-ground floors and part of the development's basement. The main entrance on the first floor services the entire building, whereas two additional entries lead into a second floor bedroom and the grand stairhall of the triplex, respectively. The entrance that opens to the main lobby leads into the dining and living room, which is connected to a front-facing den through a gallery tucked behind the bar. The second floor contains 5 bedrooms, including the masters.
