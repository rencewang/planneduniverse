## Hello

**Planned Universe** is an initiative about plans of all kinds, whether it be floor plans, yatch plans, aircraft plans, urban master plans, subway plans, airport plans... Ranging from penthouses in Midtown Manhattan to single-family homes in BHPO to mansions in the Swiss Alps, from Milan to Shanghai...

The site was started because Curbed became too crammed and unusable and Tumblr died and Pinterest grew lame, and it hopes to become a sanctuary for whatever small portion of the internet who shares the same weird fascination - with plans.
